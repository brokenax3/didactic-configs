# Convolutional Code
- A (2,1,4) Convolutional code has how many states? How many memory registers?
    - 8 States
    - 4 Memory Registers
    - 2 Output, 1 Input, 4 Memory Registers

# Viterbi Decoding
- Why Faster than exhaustive search?
    - When there are more competitive path, less competitive path is removed
    - Reduce size of search space
    - Exhaustive search will have to search all paths

# Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA)
- Node will always check the channel or whether the channel is busy before transmission

# Backoff and Contention Window
- Reduce the probability of collision
- Assumption that current contention window is too small if there is collision
    - A device doubling contention window
    - Reduce probability that device will select the same backoff time

# Optimal Probability of Success
- Refer to Tutorial 4

# Medium Access Control
- Frequency Division Multiple Access
    - Each Station transmits on a different frequency
- Aloha
    - A station transmits whenever it has a packet in queue
- Carrier Sense Multiple Access (Collision Detection)
    - A jamming signal sent when another packet is detected
- Polling/ Master and Slave
    - A station transmits only when receives a poll message
- Carrier Sense Multiple Access (Collision Avoidance)
    - Station transmits RTS to reserve channel

# Carrier Sense Multiple Access (Collision Detection)
- Frame size 
$$2 \times T_{prop}$$

- Cable Length affects 
$$T_{prop}$$

# Switches/ Hubs/ Bridges
- Switch is a layer 2 device
    - Always record the source MAC Address of a frame
    - Forwarding Table
        - MAC Address and channel it is connected to
- All machines on the same channel will process all frames transmitted on the channel

# Ethernet

![Ethernet Frame Format](img/ethernetframeformat.png)

# Distributed Coordination Function (DCF)
- Listen before talking (Carrier Sense)
- Handshaking to infer collisions
    - DATA-ACK Packets
- Collision Avoidance

# WLAN Traffic
- Bursty Traffic (DCF)
- Fixed Traffic (PCF)

# Network Layer - Layer 3
- To allow computers connected over different link technologies to inter-operate with one another

# IPv4 Datagram

![IPv4 Datagram](img/ipv4datagram.png)

- Every number represents 4 bits
- Represented as hexadecimal
- Don't Fragment
    - DF = 1
- Packet is a Fragment
    - DF = 0
    - M = 1
- Last Fragment
    - DF = 0
    - M = 0

## Checksum
- Add Row by Row without checksum itself with carry adding into bottom sum

## Router
- AND Netmask with incoming IP to obtain Network ID
    - More matching bits
