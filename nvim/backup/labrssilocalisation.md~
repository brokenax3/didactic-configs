# Framework
- Three Parts:
    - RSSI in Free Space
        - Understanding how RSSI can be used for Trilateration
    - Log-Distance Shadowing
        - Understanding the influence of environmental factors and noise on localisation
    - Contour Plot for RSSI
        - Visualising the RSSI in the environment surrounding wireless access points

# Work that will have to be done
- Generating different datasets from a selected location
- Experiment involving noise can have a simulated more noisy RSSI as receiver is at a larger distance from transmitter
- Skeleton Code for plotting and importing the datasets provided

# Self Research

## Rayleigh Fading Channel
- On MATLAB, Rayleigh Fading Channel accepts an input signal and provides an output of the channel-impaired signal
    - Not sure how this works with Received Signal Strength Indicator
    - Maybe best demonstrated with a set signal rather than RSSI
- RSSI is already an indicator and does not have phase difference (To my understanding)

Received Signal Strength Indicator in Free Space

# Idea for Experimentation without being in the laboratory
- Identifying the accuracy of 2-D indoor localisation with varying distances **(Not trilateration)**
- Having access to a WiFi access point and phone to measure RSSI values
    - Building a path loss model measuring actual distance and RSSI value obtained from mobile devices
    - With varying distances, identify the error as distance from transmitter and receiver increases
