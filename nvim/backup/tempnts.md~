# Framework
- Fixed transmitter location, randomised receiver location (Localisation Part)
    - Pre-made datasets for different groups/ students (Easier to maintain without error)
    - Generated datasets for different groups/ students (High differential but higher possibility of error and time needed)
- Transmitter will broadcast with set value choosing between $\pm 1 \rightarrow 2$ randomly
    - Simulation of noise with sudden spikes with a range of $\pm 4 \rightarrow 8$
- Part 1 (Without Introduction of Noise in Channel)
    - Building/ Given Basic Channel Model
        - Understanding Path Loss and the requirements of indoor localisation
    - Localisation using Channel Model Built
- Part 2 (With Introduction of Noise in Channel)
    - Identifying the associated errors from indoor localisation
    - Accuracy of indoor localisation and improvements that can be done

## Work that will have to be done
- Generating different datasets from a selected location
- Experiment involving noise can have a simulated more noisy RSSI as receiver is at a larger distance from transmitter
- Skeleton Code for plotting and importing the datasets provided

# Experiment 

## Introduction to Localisation using Trilateration and Received Signal Strength Indicator
- Importance of non-gps localisation
- Requirements to be satisfied before trilateration using RSSI measurements can be done

## Building a Channel Model Plot based on the RSSI from one Transmitter and Receiver Pair
- Given several datasets from obtaining RSSI at different distances between the Transmitter and Receiver
- Import the data for processing in MATLAB
    - Organising the data according to distances 
        - Each distance will have data of 10 values
- Plotting the Channel Model on MATLAB
- Observation on the effect on distance on RSSI
- Understanding the parameters used for Log-distance path loss model for localisation
    - What values are required to be extracted from the channel model plot for localisation?

## Localisation using the Channel Model Plot
- Given RSSI measurements at different distances and fixed Transmitter location
- Importing and organising the datasets for processing in MATLAB
- Determine the location of the receiver measuring the RSSI provided using the Channel Model Plot
- Plotting the location of transmitter and receiver

## Building a Channel Model Plot based on the RSSI from one Transmitter and Receiver Pair (With Noise)
- Similar method to the part without noise introduced
- Observation on effect of noisy environments on RSSI

## Localisation using the Channel Model Plot (With Noise)
- Similar method to the part without noise introduced
- Several different distances of Transmitter and Receiver locations tested
- Identifying that the increasing distance between Transmitter and Receiver affects localisation accuracy
- Measuring the absolute error and relative error of localisation in noisy environments

# Hardware Section

## Idea for Experimentation without being in the laboratory
- Identifying the accuracy of 2-D indoor localisation with varying distances **(Not trilateration)**
- Having access to a WiFi access point and phone to measure RSSI values
    - Building a path loss model measuring actual distance and RSSI value obtained from mobile devices
    - With varying distances, identify the error as distance from transmitter and receiver increases

# Remarks
1. Uncertain if the experiment might be too short
2. The harder parts for the experiment might only be importing, organising the data and figuring out how the channel model plot can be used for localisation
3. Experiment length can be increased with more datasets
4. Note that transmitter with noise and without noise randomness is just a placeholder number and will be adjusted for more reasonable variations
